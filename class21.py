#IN THIS CLASS WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE DOC STRING AND PEP 8
#Doc String is used like a comment but it is not a comment .It is the description of funtion,
#Class and method 
#Note:---  Doc String is written in just below the funtion name above the body of the funtion

  
               #Example 1

def square(n):
  ''' Takes in a number n and returns in a square of n '''  #Here it works as a description
  print(n**2)
square(6)
print(square.__doc__)    #__doc__ work as a keyword for print the description of funtion
print(square)
