#IN THIS CLASS WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE FUNCTION
#    #Funtion is used to when we have to use the things for manytime then we make a funtion
# #   to reduce the line of code and we can easliy use the funtion unlimited time by simply
# #   calling the function name

#    #NOTE:-----   We have to make the funtion always at the top of the of program
#                        #EXAMPLE1(Example of mean)
# print("program to find the Average:")
# def gmean(a,b):
#     mean=(a+b)/2
#     print(mean)
# a=int(input("Enter the first number:"))
# b=int(input("Enter the second number:"))
# gmean(a,b)
# gmean(a,b)
# if(a>b):
#     print("First number is greater")
# else:
#     print("Second number is greater")
